================================================================================

Note : This implementation of "robotfindskitten" contains no code from the
original code base - it only mimicks the original software's behavior. However,
the non-kitten messages comes from this file : http://www.crummy.com/software/robotfindskitten/nki/vanilla.nki.
More info about this file can be obtained from there : http://www.crummy.com/software/robotfindskitten/

The startup message can be found in the original game's source code there:

The robotfindskitten's Web page mentions that the original POSIX code is under
GPL. (http://robotfindskitten.org/)

I (leonardr@segfault.org) wrote this program.

Pete Peterson (pedro@zork.net) supplied about [many] non-kitten messages.

Frederick Lee (phaethon@csua.ucla.edu) showed me how to get my beloved
IBM character set under Linux.

Some ncurses initialization code stolen from "Writing Programs with
NCURSES", by Eric S. Raymond and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim. I don't know if
there's an official URL, but it's only a Google search away.

Nick Moffitt (nick@zork.net) and George Moffitt (zen@zork.net)
refactored the code and added new key commands as well as non-kitten
messages.
